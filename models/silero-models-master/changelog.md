# Plans

Current plans w/o any set dates:

- Languages
  - Focus on huge English model update
  - Cover remaning popular Internet languages for CE and EE editions (in progress) - now thinking only about adding French and updating the existing languages
  - We decided not to pursue the following languages: Italian, Portugese, Polish, Czech for now
  - ~~Add some non-core languages only as CE edition~~ Added Ukrainian v1 and v3
- Speed
  - ~~Reduce CE model size to 10-20 MB w/o quality degradation~~ Final size is about 30M w/o losing quality, going lower is still possible with losing quality
  - Add quantized models (x2 speed) - total speed up for smaller models is between 2x and 3x for a `small` models, for `xxsmall` - around 3x
- New products
  - Add denoising - still in progress
  - ~~Add a large number of production grade TTS models - close to finish, soon to be released~~ Added Silero TTS models `v1`

# Updates

## 2021-04-21 Add `v3` xsmall STT English Models

Huge update for English!

- Polish docs;
- Add `xsmall` and `xsmall_q` model flavours for `en_v3`;
- Polish performance benchmarks page a bit;

## 2021-04-20 Add `v3` STT English Models

Huge update for English!

- Default model (`jit` or `onnx`) size is reduced almost by 50% without sacrificing quality (!);
- New model flavours: `jit_q` (smaller quantized model), `jit_skip` (with exposed skip connections), `jit_large` (higher quality model), `onnx_large` (!);
- New smallest model `jit_q` is only 40M in size (!);
- Tensorflow checkpoints discontinued;
- New performance [benchmarks](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models/wiki/Quality-Benchmarks#en-v3) - default models are on par with previous models and Google, large models mostly outperform Google (!);
- Even more quality improvements coming soon (!);
- CE benchmarks coming soon;
- `xsmall` model was created (2x smaller than the default), but I could not quantize it. I am looking into creating a `xxsmall` model;
- Still working on making EE models fully JIT-traceable;

## 2021-03-29 Add `v1` TTS Models

- Added `v1` TTS [models](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models#text-to-speech);
- Add TTS [performance benchmarks](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models/wiki/Performance-Benchmarks#tts);
- Polish existing [wiki](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models/wiki/Performance-Benchmarks);
- Progress on an additional method of [model compression](https://t.me/snakers4/2689);

## 2021-03-03 Add `xxsmall` Speed Metrics

- See metrics [here](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models/wiki/Performance-Benchmarks#speed-benchmarks)
- Note that this is only an acoustic model, full end-to-end system metrics differ, though `xxsmall` metrics trickle down for CPU systems

## 2021-03-03 Ukrainian Model V3 Released

- Fine tuned from a commercial production Russian model
- Trained on a larger corpus (around 1,000 hours)
- Model flavors: `jit` (CPU or GPU), `jit_q` (quantized and CPU only) and `onnx` (ONNX)
- Huge model speed improvements for CPU inference (!roughly 3x faster!) compared to the previous one, comparable with `xxsmall` from [here](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models/wiki/Performance-Benchmarks#speed-benchmarks)
- Will be dropping TF support altogether
- No proper quality benchmarks for an experimental model though

## 2021-02-15 Some Organizational Issues

- Migrate to our own model hosting
- Solve large parasite traffic / DDOS issue, source still unknown
- Remove the CDN
- Some community / answers tidying up
- Major progress on [silero-vad](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad)
- Major progress on TTS, preparing for a release

## 2020-12-04 Add EE Distro Sizing and New Speed Metrics

- https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models/wiki/Performance-Benchmarks

## 2020-11-26 Fix TensorFlow Examples

## 2020-11-03 [Experimental] Ukrainian Model V1 Released

- An experimental model
- Trained from a small community contributed [corpus](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models/issues/30)
- **New** Full model size reduced to 85 MB
- **New** - quantized model is ony 25 MB
- No TF or ONNX models
- Will be re-released a fine-tuned model from a larger Russian corpus upon V3 release

## 2020-11-03 English Model V2 Released

- A minor release, i.e. other models not affected
